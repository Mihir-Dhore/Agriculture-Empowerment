        <section id="cropSelection" class="tips-section">
            <h2>1. Crop Selection</h2>
            <p>Different types of crops need different soil types, nutrients, and water. Also, the amount of water
                required by the
                plant is dependent on the growing season and the climate where it is grown. Proper crop selection is the
                main factor in
                successful crop farming. Some important crop selection factors are;</p>

        <section id="soilPreparation" class="tips-section">
            <h2>2. Soil Preparation</h2>
            <p>For growing crops, the soil in which it is to be grown is prepared by ploughing, levelling, and manuring.
                Ploughing is
                the way of loosening and digging of soil and this helps in proper soil aeration. The soil is distributed
                evenly and
                levelled in the process known as levelling. The soil is then manured. Soil texture, compaction, cation
                exchange
                capacity, and organic matter content are just a few of the variables that can impact crop growth.
                Planting crops that
                are well-suited to your soil characteristics gives you a better chance of success in agriculture.
                Growers can have an
                impact on soil characteristics through some cultivation practices, by adding amendments, using certain
                planting methods,
                or employing methods to alter factors such as soil temperature, moisture retention, or compaction.
                Though, working with
                a soil that already meets most of a given crop’s needs increases the chances of success.</p>

        <section id="seedselection" class="tips-section">
            <h2>3. Seed Selection</h2>
            <p>Seed selection is very important for crop growth. A seed must be good so it will grow into a plant
                otherwise we will not
                get the result and we must select good and healthy seeds.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="seedSowing" class="tips-section">
            <h2>4. Seed Sowing</h2>
            <p>The selection of seeds of good quality crop strains is the main stage of sowing. After the soil
                preparation,
                these seeds are dispersed in the field, and this is known as sowing. Seed sowing can be done manually,
                by hand,
                or by using seed drilling machines. Some crops like paddy are first grown into seedlings in a small
                region and
                then transplanted to the main field. Good quality seeds are out of reach of the majority of farmers
                because of
                the exorbitant prices of better seeds.</p>

        <section id="irrigation" class="tips-section">
            <h2>5. Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Any sustainable agricultural practice needs a good level of irrigation at regular intervals. The modern
                method to
                begin it is the drip irrigation system. Also, this helps you in saving water by not wasting oodles of
                extra
                amount or losing it all quickly due to the heat. As it can be machine-controlled, the supervision
                becomes
                easier.</p>
            <p>Irrigation meaning is the supply of water. Sources of water can be wells, ponds, lakes, canals, and dams,
                etc.
                Over irrigation can lead to waterlogging and damage the crop. Then, this is frequency and interval
                between
                successive irrigation need to be controlled.</p>

        <section id="fertilizersManures" class="tips-section">
            <h2>6. Fertilizers and Manures</h2>
            <p>Organic methods will help promote healthy crop growth and some examples of organic methods include
                composting,
                mulching, and using bio-fertilizers. Vermicomposting is also another excellent method of introducing
                important
                nutrients into the soil naturally.</p>
            <p>The different types of fertilizers are – Inorganic fertilizer- Nitrogen fertilizer, Phosphorus
                fertilizer.
                Organic fertilizers are agricultural waste, livestock manure, and municipal sludge.</p>
            <p>Crops need nutrients to grow and produce yield. Therefore, the supply of nutrients at regular intervals
                is
                necessary. Manuring is the step where nutritional supplements are provided, and these supplements can be
                natural
                (manure) or chemical compounds (fertilizers). Also, manure is the decomposition product of plant and
                animal
                wastes. Fertilizers are chemical compounds consisting of plant nutrients and are farmed commercially.
                Apart from
                providing essential nutrients to the crop, manure replenishes soil fertility as well. Other main
                approaches for
                soil replenishment are vermicomposting, crop rotation, and planting leguminous plants.</p>

        <section id="weedManagement" class="tips-section">
            <h2>7. Weed Management</h2>
            <p>Generally, weeds are unwanted plants that grow among crops. They are removed by using weedicides, by
                manually
                pulling them with hands, and some weeds are removed during soil preparation. It can be a stumbling block
                to
                producing crops. Weeds can reduce your crop yields and consume resources intended for crops.</p>
            <p>For controlling weeds, there are many options in organic farming like manual weeding (hand removal,
                pulling, and
                cutting), mowing, mechanical cultivation, and thermal control (flaming).</p>

            <h2>8. Tips for Pests and Diseases Management in Agriculture</h2>
            <p>Major plant pests and diseases are viruses, bacteria, fungi, and insects greatly impair their
                productivity. Crops
                can be protected from several pests and diseases by using pesticides and biocontrol agents. The
                cultivated
                grains should be stored safely to avoid product loss.</p>
            <p>Some important mechanical and physical control methods are tillage, mowing, cutting, and mulching.</p>

        <section id="harvesting" class="tips-section">
            <h2>9. Tips for Harvesting Plants</h2>
            <p>Once the crop is matured, it is cut and gathered carefully, this process is called harvesting. Followed
                by
                harvesting, grains are separated from the chaff either by using threshing, or manually on a small scale
                (winnowing).</p>
            <p>For harvest procedures, the subsequent points are important by selecting the correct harvest time refers
                to the
                ripeness and maturity of the produce. Optimal harvest times are early morning hours or the evening when
                temperature levels are lower. Harvesting of delicate and high-value produce is best done manually.</p>
